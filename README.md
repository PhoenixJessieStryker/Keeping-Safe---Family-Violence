# Keeping-Safe---Family-Violence
Vodafone sponsor project - we are creating a safe app to help 'Edutain' rangitahi members be aware of domestic violence


To whom it may concern,

I have had the pleasure of Phoenix join a two-week prototyping foundation to produce an edutainment app for psychologists that is used for the benefit of teenage at-risk-youth. The team of 8 was based at Vodafone Xone in Christchurch, during September 2018.

Phoenix is an incredibly talented, creative and knowledgeable team member that built a 'game' in Unity for IOS using C#. Always the first in and the last to go home, it was his contribution that significantly within a team that built the design and the specs of the Keeping Safe / Kia Wehikore APP.

Entering a new team, in a new city far from home, and to be amongst some of New Zealand's foremost experts in this field, could be daunting. However, Phoenix was able to confidently merge with the team dynamics and get up to speed Learning a new language ( C# ) for the first time with grueling deadlines on a fast-paced project. His enthusiasm, dedication, commitment, and leadership skills is a testament to his personality, in having a strong desire to execute quality solutions in the tech environment.

His calm sensible and passionate nature were a wonderful addition to the team. Punctuality, professionalism, and commitment to the cause were consistently displayed throughout the two weeks.

I would happily recommend Phoenix as a future employee, in any company that values creativity, professionalism, integrity and Leadership experience.
